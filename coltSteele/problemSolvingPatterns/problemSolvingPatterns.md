# PROBLEM SOLVING USEFULL PATTERNS

## FREQUENCY COUNTERS

- This pattern uses objects or sets to collect values/frequencies of values
- This can often avoid the need for nested loops or O(N^2) operations with arrays / strings
- Used to compare values of multiple inputs
- Compares keys and frecuency of their values

## MULTIPLE POINTERS

- Creating **pointers** or values that correspond to an index or position and move towards the beginning, end or middle based on a certain condition
- Very efficient for solving problems with minimal space complexity as well
- The values has to be **sorted**
