# PROBLEM SOLVING USEFULL PATTERNS

## FREQUENCY COUNTERS

- This pattern uses objects or sets to collect values/frequencies of values
- This can often avoid the need for nested loops or O(N^2) operations with arrays / strings
- Used to compare values of multiple inputs
- Compares keys and frecuency of their values

## MULTIPLE POINTERS

- Creating **pointers** or values that correspond to an index or position and move towards the beginning, end or middle based on a certain condition
- Very efficient for solving problems with minimal space complexity as well
- The values has to be **sorted**

## SLIDING WINDOW

- This pattern involves creating a window which can either be an array or number from one position to another
- Depending on a certain condition, the window either increases or closes (and a new window is created)
- Very useful for keeping track of a subset of data in an array/string etc.

# DIVIDE AND CONQUER

- This pattern involves dividing a data set into smaller chunks and then repeating a process with a subset of data.
- This pattern can tremendously decrease time complexity
